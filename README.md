## DataSet: Remote sensing - drone aerial images around photovoltaic panels

In 2019, the images were given by the company - Korea plant service and engineering (KPS) of the Korea electric power corporation (KEPCO) (we thanks to Prof. B.-C. Shin at Chonnam National University, South Korea, for data acquisition), and we resized them to 200 by 250 resolution for public use.
